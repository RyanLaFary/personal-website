	<h1>Jeeps</h1>

	<p>This website is for people who own a Jeep Wrangler and love to talk about it, work on it, take it off-road, or just wnat to get more involved in the comunity! The Jeep Wrangler has been around for many generations and has always offered that something you just can't get from other vehicles. It gives you a sense of freedom and the capability to go off-road knowing that you'll make it to your destination safely.</p> 

	<p>The Jeep Wrangler Community is always there for one another and loves to get together to just enjoy the vehicle they drive! To some however, it might just be the vehicle that gets you from point A to point B. But for most, it's the vehicle that can get you from point A to wherever you want!</p>
